Stability   : experimental

This is a wrapped version of @Control.Concurrent.Async@ with types generalized
from 'IO' to all monads in either 'MonadBase' or 'MonadBaseControl'.

All the functions restore the monadic effects in the forked computation
unless specified otherwise.

#if MIN_VERSION_monad_control(1, 0, 0)
If your monad stack satisfies @'StM' m a ~ a@ (e.g. the reader monad), consider
using @Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted.Safe@ module, which prevents you from
messing up monadic effects.
